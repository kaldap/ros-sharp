		//
		// If the covariance of the measurement is known, it should be filled in (if all you know is the
		// variance of each measurement, e.g. from the datasheet, just put those along the diagonal)
		// A covariance matrix of all zeros will be interpreted as "covariance unknown", and to use the
		// data a covariance will have to be assumed or gotten from some other source

		// If you have no estimate for one of the data elements (e.g. your IMU doesn't produce an orientation
		// estimate), please set element 0 of the associated covariance matrix to -1
		// If you are interpreting this message, please check for a value of -1 in the first element of each
		// covariance matrix, and disregard the associated estimate.
